          <h1>PROGRAMMERS</h1>
        Debugging is a very important task in the software development process
        since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for
        its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because
        their specification does not require compilers to perform as much
        checking as other languages. Use of a static code analysis tool can help
        detect some possible problems. Normally the first step in debugging is
        to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for
        example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also,
        specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to
        reproduce the problem. After the bug is reproduced, the input of the
        program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For
        example, when a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some
        large source file, a simplification of the test case that results in
        only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to
        reproduce the same crash. Trial-and-error/divide-and-conquer is needed:
        the programmer will try to remove some parts of the original test case
        and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a
        GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the
        original problem description and check if remaining actions are
        sufficient for bugs to appear. Scripting and breakpointing is also part
        of this process.
